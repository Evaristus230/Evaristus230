## 🌟 Featured Projects

These are tools I’ve built to turn theory into hands-on skill — each links to a dedicated repo with full docs, setup, and use cases.

### 🔹 [Realistic Credential Traffic Generator for Wireshark Training](https://github.com/Evaristus230/wireshark-traffic-simulator)  
> A **production-grade traffic simulator** that generates *authentic, multi-protocol login flows* — designed to train analysts in spotting credential exposure, protocol quirks, and attack patterns **in real packet captures**.

🛠️ **What it simulates — safely & ethically**:  
- ✅ HTTP POST logins (e.g., web forms)  
- ✅ Basic/Digest/NTLM auth (Base64, challenge-response)  
- ✅ FTP, Telnet, SMTP, IMAP — **cleartext credentials** - ✅ LDAP binds, MySQL/PostgreSQL auth, SMB sessions  
- ✅ JWT, API keys, fake RDP/VNC handshakes  

🔐 **Key Features**:  
- Generates **19+ protocol flows** with *realistic fake credentials* - Mimics human timing → no robotic traffic  
- Works out-of-the-box on **Parrot Linux** - Used in my internal lab training to teach **packet-level threat hunting**

### 🔹 [Comprehensive Nessus Vulnerability Assessment Lab](https://github.com/Evaristus230/Nessus-Lab-Scan-Project)
> A **methodical, real-world vulnerability scanning project** using Tenable Nessus to assess multi-OS environments. Designed to teach risk prioritization, CVSS interpretation, and remediation strategy through hands-on analysis.

🛠️ **What it covers — ethically & in isolation**:
- ✅ Full-scope scans of Metasploitable 2, Metasploitable 3, and Windows 10
- ✅ Identification of critical exposures (e.g., EternalBlue, unpatched Apache, cleartext services)
- ✅ Correlation of CVEs, CVSS scores, and exploit availability
- ✅ Authenticated vs. unauthenticated scan comparison
- ✅ Professional-grade reporting for technical and non-technical audiences

🔐 **Key Features**:
- Follows industry-standard workflow (**Plan → Scan → Analyze → Report**)
- Includes fictional red team/blue team context to frame findings in operational reality
- Generates a formal PDF report with executive summary and risk matrix
- Built for Parrot OS + Kali-compatible environments
