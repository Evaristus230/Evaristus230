## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are some of my recent projects — built to solve real problems, not just follow tutorials.

### 🔹 [Self-Contained Pentest Lab](https://github.com/Evaristus230/cyber-lab-env)
> Dockerized lab with OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA, ZAP, and Burp — designed for repeatable recon & exploitation practice.

### 🔹 [Directory Discovery Response Analyzer](https://github.com/Evaristus230/http-status-inspector)
> Python script that categorizes HTTP responses during directory brute-forcing — helps avoid false negatives.

### 🔹 [Technical Tutorials](https://github.com/Evaristus230/cyber-tutorials)
> Step-by-step guides on using tools like gobuster, sqlmap, and hping3 — written for beginners who want to understand *why*, not just *how*.
