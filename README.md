## 🌟 Featured Projects

These are tools I’ve built to turn theory into hands-on skill — each links to a dedicated repo with full docs, setup, and use cases.

### 🔹 [Realistic Credential Traffic Generator for Wireshark Training](https://github.com/Evaristus230/wireshark-traffic-simulator)  
> A **production-grade traffic simulator** that generates *authentic, multi-protocol login flows* — designed to train analysts in spotting credential exposure, protocol quirks, and attack patterns **in real packet captures**.

🛠️ **What it simulates — safely & ethically**:  
- ✅ HTTP POST logins (e.g., web forms)  
- ✅ Basic/Digest/NTLM auth (Base64, challenge-response)  
- ✅ FTP, Telnet, SMTP, IMAP — **cleartext credentials**  
- ✅ LDAP binds, MySQL/PostgreSQL auth, SMB sessions  
- ✅ JWT, API keys, fake RDP/VNC handshakes  

🔐 **Key Features**:  
- Generates **19+ protocol flows** with *realistic fake credentials*  
- Mimics human timing → no robotic traffic  
- Works out-of-the-box on **Parrot Linux**  
- Used in my internal lab training to teach **packet-level threat hunting**

🔹 Nessus Vulnerability Assessment of a Heterogeneous Lab Environment
A comprehensive vulnerability analysis using Tenable Nessus across a controlled lab (Metasploitable 2/3, Windows 10, and Kali) — designed to teach critical thinking in risk prioritization, CVSS interpretation, and remediation planning from a defender’s perspective.

🛠️ What it covers — methodically & ethically:

✅ Unauthenticated & authenticated scans against legacy and modern OS targets
✅ CVSS-based severity triage (Critical → Info) with real-world context
✅ Detection of high-impact flaws (e.g., EternalBlue, outdated Apache, SMBv1)
✅ Full Nessus policy customization for heterogeneous environments
✅ Professional-style reporting with executive summaries and technical deep dives
🔐 Key Features:

Fully replicable in isolated lab environments (VirtualBox/VMware)
Includes scan artifacts, policy templates, and evidence-backed findings
Bridges offensive knowledge (Metasploit targets) with defensive validation
Teaches how to translate scanner output into business risk

💡 Why this matters:
"Knowing how an attack works is half the battle. Knowing why it was possible — and how to prevent it systematically — is the other half. This project closes that loop."
